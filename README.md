Development Information website for Totally Information

This is a quick information website from Julian Knight @ Totally Information. 
It will be used for keeping track of various hints, tips and knowledge regarding development.

https://totallyinformation.github.io

It will continue to be a work in progress for a long time no doubt as I learn more about Jekyll and
GitHub Pages. I will also, over time, move information from my personal notebooks (Microsoft OneNote)
to here.

Most of the pages should have the Disqus comment service enabled so please raise issues there first.
Otherwise, feel free to raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/TotallyInformation.github.io/issues) as well.

Regards, Julian Knight, [Totally Information](https://www.totallyinformation.com).

GitHub pages use Jekyll which in turn uses [Liquid](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/liquid).

This is a list of `tags` that can be used. Tags appear within {% raw %}`{% tagname %}`{% endraw %} markup.
Matching end-tags are shown in brackets.

- raw (endraw) - stops Liquid from parsing the content so that you can include double braces for example.

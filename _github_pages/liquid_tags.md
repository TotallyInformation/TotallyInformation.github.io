This is a list of `tags` that can be used in Jekyll. Tags appear within {% raw %}`{% tagname %}`{% endraw %} markup.
Matching end-tags are shown in brackets.

GitHub pages use Jekyll which in turn uses [Liquid](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid).
See also the [official tags reference](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/tags).

### Control flow tags
- [case](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/tags/control-flow-tags#case-when) (when, else, endcase) - a switch statement
- if (else, elsif, endif) - execute block only if the condition is met
- raw (endraw) - stops Liquid from parsing the content so that you can include double braces for example.
- unless (endunless) - execute block only if the condition is **not** met

Some reference sites and links for Jekyll, Liquid and GitHub Pages.

## Reference, help and tips

- [Liquid Reference](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid) - the official documentation for Liquid which is used by Jekyll
- [Jekyll Codex](https://jekyllcodex.org/getting-started/) - General information plus snippets that require not plugins (useful for GitHub Pages).


## Cloud services

- [Cloud Cannon](https://cloudcannon.com/) - Build and host Jekyll websites
  Free for test sites with GitHub and Dropbox source syncing.
  Can use this to do the donkey work of compiling the static site which can then be hosted anywhere. More options than GitHub Pages.

          Please note that this version of the site is no longer being updated.
          All content has been merged with my IT Blog "Much Ado About IT".

          I've found that using Jekyll to be too fragile and complex. GitHub pages are too limited.
          The blog site was on WordPress (self-hosted) but that was too slow and clunky.
          The revamped blog now uses <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and is published using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>

* [Node-RED Programming Guide](http://noderedguide.com/) free

  > The node red guide is a series of lectures designed to get you started with Node-RED. Starting from the very basics, it introduces you to how Node-RED works and how to get the most out of its built in nodes. Each lecture consists of a series of hands-on examples that take you from basic to intermediate Node-RED programming in easy to follow steps.

* [A Developer's guide to Node-RED (Coursera, IBM)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/developer-nodered) $ (cost and pricing is far from clear, some content may be free)

  > The course is aimed at learners that want to advance their Node-RED skills. The course assumes an understanding of programming. There is also an assumption that you have a basic understanding of Node-RED, if not you may want to look at the course "[A developer's guide to the Internet of Things (IoT)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/developer-iot)", which teaches the basics of Node-RED. The course also uses the IBM Cloud (previously known as Bluemix), so assumes basic knowledge of using the IBM Cloud, again the "A developer's guide to the Internet of Things (IoT)" course provides this prerequisite information.
